//! Splitting a mesh into connected components, and recombining them (#85).
//!
//! Two providers already walked this graph to count components and returned
//! only the count, discarding the partition they had just built. This owns
//! the partition; the counters become callers of it.
//!
//! Connectivity is by shared vertex index, not by geometric proximity: two
//! triangles that touch in space but reference distinct indices belong to
//! distinct components. Welding is `axiolid-heal`'s job and stays there.
