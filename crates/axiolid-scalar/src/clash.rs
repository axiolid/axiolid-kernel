//! Mesh interference: the narrow phase (#4).
//!
//! # What this closes
//!
//! `Bvh::overlap_pairs` reports pairs whose *bounding boxes* overlap, and
//! `triangle_triangle_relation` classifies *one* triangle pair exactly. Nothing
//! joined them, so there was no way to ask the question a model checker
//! actually asks: do these two solids interfere, and by how much?
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! Broad phase over triangle AABBs to reject the quadratic majority, then the
//! exact predicate on survivors. The predicate is unconditionally correct for
//! binary64 input, so a reported `Penetrating` is a fact, not an estimate.
//!
//! Penetration *depth* is a separate matter: it is measured, approximate, and
//! reported as evidence rather than folded into the verdict. Conflating an
//! exact topological answer with an approximate metric one is how a checker
//! ends up unable to say why it flagged something.
