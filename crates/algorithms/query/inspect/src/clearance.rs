//! Closest approach between two meshes.

//! Clearance is the clash-detection question: not "do these collide" but "if
//! not, by how much do they miss". A boolean answers the first and discards
//! the second.
//!
//! The BVH supplies candidate triangle pairs within the search length; the
//! exact distance for each surviving pair is computed directly. Distance is
//! a measurement, not a predicate, so f64 is the right currency here and
//! ADR 0045's reasoning applies: the value is reported, not used to decide
//! topology.
