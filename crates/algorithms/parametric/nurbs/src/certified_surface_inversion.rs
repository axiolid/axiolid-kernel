//! Globally certified closest-point inversion for B-spline surfaces (#7).
//!
//! # Why inversion is not projection
//!
//! `project_surface_certified` answers "how far is this point from the
//! surface". Inversion answers "which parameters name this point", and that
//! is a strictly stronger claim: it requires the answer to be UNIQUE.
//!
//! A projection certificate retains EVERY box that could hold a global
//! minimizer. On a sphere-like patch a pole point is equidistant from a whole
//! parameter circle, so many boxes survive and no single (u, v) names the
//! point. Returning one of them would be an arbitrary choice dressed up as a
//! certified answer. This module therefore refuses unless the surviving
//! cover is a single connected box: ambiguity is reported, never resolved by
//! picking a representative.
//!
//! Inversion also asserts the point lies ON the surface. That is a separate
//! obligation from uniqueness, checked against the certified distance LOWER
//! bound so a miss cannot be absorbed by a loose representative evaluation.
