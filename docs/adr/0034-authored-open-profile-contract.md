# ADR 0034: Authored open profiles are graph declarations, not areas

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-01
- **Deciders:** Axiolid maintainers
- **Supersedes:** —

## Context

A source model can declare an exact bounded open two-dimensional path as a profile. Such a declaration carries neither an enclosed area nor a width. Closing it would fabricate an edge and an area; treating it as a centre line would fabricate width semantics.

Axiolid already has two relevant but intentionally different vocabularies:

- `axiolid-profile::Profile` describes sweep sections with area semantics;
- `axiolid-model` can preserve atomic and relational exact 2D curves, including trimmed, composite, offset, and parameter curves.

Putting a graph `NodeId` in `axiolid-profile` would reverse crate layering. Copying a relational curve into an owned atomic profile value would lose exact composition and trim intent. Reusing mesh-plane section contours would replace authored exact geometry with evaluated approximate linework and would cross the IFC/plan boundary forbidden by ADR 0033.

## Decision

We will represent an authored bounded open profile as `axiolid_model::OpenProfile`, a graph payload whose `path` references a prior exact 2D curve-family node.

- `GeometryNode::OpenProfile` is distinct from `GeometryNode::Profile`.
- It carries no area, width, closure edge, tessellation, or manufacturing semantics.
- Graph construction accepts only conservatively bounded-open 2D paths:
  - source-open polylines with at least two finite controls and distinct authored endpoints;
  - source-open B-splines with finite controls and knots, coherent degree/knot/multiplicity cardinalities, and optional strictly positive finite weights;
  - trimmed 2D curves whose start and end selectors are finite, 2D-compatible, present in the declared preferred representation, and not exactly equal in a shared representation;
  - non-empty composites, finite-distance 2D offsets without a 3D reference direction, and parameter curves whose referenced paths satisfy the same contract;
  - instances preserve the referenced curve family and require finite transforms.
- Curve-family and bounded-open validation visit each reachable graph node at most once per check, so shared append-only DAGs do not expand into exponential work.
- Infinite lines, atomic circles/ellipses, source-closed or exactly self-closing polylines, source-closed or structurally invalid B-splines, non-finite curve/offset/instance data, 3D offset reference directions, empty composites, missing or non-finite trim endpoints, 3D trim selectors, exactly equal parameter/point trim endpoints, 3D curves, and non-curves are rejected.
- Endpoint coincidence and relational closure that cannot be established from identical authored selectors remain evaluator validation responsibilities. The payload preserves the source declaration; it does not claim a numerical proof that arbitrary relational endpoints differ.
- Existing solid operations continue to accept only area `Profile` nodes. Passing an `OpenProfile` to extrusion, revolution, or any other area-profile edge is a graph type error.
- The scalar mesh compiler reports standalone open-profile compilation as missing `CurveEvaluation`; it never triangulates or closes the path.

## Alternatives considered

| Option | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| Add an open variant to `axiolid_profile::Profile` | Makes area-only generator inputs admit a no-area state and pushes runtime rejection into every consumer. |
| Store `Curve2` directly in `axiolid-profile` | Cannot preserve graph-level trimmed/composite/offset curve relations without copying or flattening. |
| Store `NodeId` in `axiolid-profile` | Reverses the L1 representation → L2 graph dependency direction. |
| Reuse `CenterLineProfile` | A centre line implies a width and area; an authored open profile does not. |
| Close the path | Fabricates an unstated edge and enclosed area. |
| Use mesh-plane section contours | Substitutes evaluated approximate linework for authored exact geometry and confuses representation with plan derivation. |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Importers can preserve exact open-profile intent without format-specific types.
- Invalid use as an area profile is rejected at graph construction.
- Existing area-profile and generation APIs remain semver-compatible.
- Composite and trimmed source curves remain graph references rather than flattened approximations.

**Negative / costs**

- Consumers that need points must explicitly request curve evaluation.
- Exact endpoint openness for arbitrary relational curves cannot be proven structurally and requires an evaluator.
- Importers must lower the path curve first and then append the declaration node.

**Follow-ups / risks to watch**

- Add a result-bearing bounded evaluator if consumers need a certified open-path endpoint/closure report.
- Do not broaden solid-operation profile edges to accept `OpenProfile`.
- Do not infer plans, regions, offsets, or manufacturing layers from this declaration.

## Relation to existing code

- `crates/representations/modeling/graph/src/node.rs` owns `OpenProfile` and `GeometryNode::OpenProfile`.
- `crates/representations/modeling/graph/src/validation.rs` enforces graph-reference and conservative bounded/open semantics.
- `crates/representations/modeling/graph/src/value.rs` provides sealed builder insertion.
- `crates/execution/compile/src/compiler.rs` classifies evaluation without manufacturing a mesh.
- ADR 0009 defines the graph layering; ADR 0033 separates authored geometry from mesh-derived section contours.
